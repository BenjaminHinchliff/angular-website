<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Benjamin, a (largely) independent developer who codes in every
  spare moment I get. This is my website where I post my projects. I love
  to mess around with whatever seems interesting to me at the moment,
  and I'm always trying to improve my skills.

    (Case in point: this site - the way back machine for this is pretty interesting)
